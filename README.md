📌 Summary
📊 I analyzed social media engagement, comparing advertisement vs. non-advertisement posts, assessing the impact of positive comments, and segmenting users by activity level using statistical analysis and data visualization.

🚀 Solution & Key Steps
1️⃣ Data Processing & Cleaning
✔ Removed missing/duplicate values
✔ Formatted date fields correctly

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🔍 Compared advertisement vs. non-advertisement posts
🔍 Analyzed the effect of positive comments on engagement
🔍 Segmented users based on activity level

3️⃣ Visualization & Statistical Analysis
📊 Used Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
📊 Conducted T-tests & quartile analysis for deeper insights

📌 Approach
I started by cleaning and preprocessing the data, ensuring consistency by removing duplicates and handling missing values. Next, I performed exploratory analysis, comparing engagement metrics across different post types and investigating the influence of positive comments. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, I visualized key trends with boxplots, scatterplots, and histograms. Finally, I applied T-tests and quartile analysis to derive meaningful insights about user behavior and engagement patterns.
